<br/>
 - Added the Fund's agent alert system about important events. For example, 9-10.12.2017 we will be on the "AVA Expo" in Saint-Petersburg, Russia, and you can look at the captured objects in person. And just through the alert system, we can remind you of that.
<br/>
 - Added the ability to invite friends to the app. The fund needs more class D!
<b>Fixes</b>
 - Correct the fall in Android Oreo (8). Also we update some libs. Their developers say it's better. And the programmer doesn't cheat programmer. But that's not accurate.
<br/>
 - Any minor corrections and improvements.
